# Setup

To run this service locally you will need the following application(s) installed locally:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Using this product

To run the application there are a few options:

1. `make start` - runs the application locally
2. `docker compose up -d` - same as option 1 but more manual?
3. _run local w/out Docker_ - Instructions for this option will not be detailed but you could do it if you really wanted to.

Once started the service will be available at http://localhost:10000. For more commands available run `make help` from the project root.
